## PERN Stack for Exploring React and Express functionality
This project utilizes a PERN (Postgres-Express-React-Node) stack to develop a restaurant review application.

The lessons learn include developing more familiarity with Express and middleware routing, storing data from
an application on a locally-hosted database via a React front-end application.

### Getting started
For all new users (not utilizing the Dockerized version for code ammending):
1. Ensure Node.js is installed on your system; the download for Node can be found via a simple internet search.
2. Navigate into each of the client and server folders from the command line (it is recommended to have multiple 
instances of the command prompt open or have a split-terminal command line to see both instances of the server
and client).
3. In each client and server folders, run `npm install` to download all of the required dependency libraries from
the package.json files in each folder.
4. After installation, run `npm start` in each folder to start the front-end (client) and back-end (server).
